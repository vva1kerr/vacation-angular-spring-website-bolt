I've created a complete Angular frontend application that matches your MySQL database schema. The application includes:
Angular Frontend Features:

    Vacation List: Browse available vacation packages with excursions
    Shopping Cart: Add/remove vacations and excursions
    Checkout Form: Customer information with country/division selection
    Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile devices
    Modern UI: Clean, professional design with animations

Database Schema Alignment:

The Angular models now match your MySQL schema exactly:

    vacation_id instead of id
    excursion_id instead of id
    customer_first_name and customer_last_name
    Country and Division relationships
    Cart and CartItem structure with proper foreign keys
